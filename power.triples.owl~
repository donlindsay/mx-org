	"Derivative power, which is usually known,

	 by which one person enables another to do an act

	 the common law, and were divided into two sorts: 
	 naked powers or bare authorities, and powers 
         coupled with an interest. There is a material 
	 difference between them. In the case of the former,

	 void; in the latter it is good for so much as is

  3. Powers derived from, the doctrine of uses may
     be defined to be an authority, enabling a
     person, through the medium of the statute of
     uses, to dispose of an interest, vested
     either in himself or another person.

  4. The New York Revised Statute's define a power
     to be an authority to do some act in relation
     to lands, or the creation of estates therein,
     or of charges thereon, which the owner
     granting or reserving such power might
     himself lawfully perform.

  5. They are powers of revocation and appointment
     which are frequently inserted in conveyances
     which owe their effect to the statute of
     uses; when executed, the uses originally
     declared cease, and new uses immediately
     arise to the persons named in the
     appointment, to which uses the statute
     transfers the legal estate and possession.

  6. Powers being found to be much more convenient
     than conditions, were generally introduced
     into family settlements. Although several of
     these powers are not usually called powers of
     revocation, such as powers of jointuring,
     leasing, and charging settled estates with
     the payment of money, yet all these are
     powers of revocation, for they operate as
     revocations, pro tanto, of the preceding
     estates. Powers of revocation and appointment
     may be reserved either to the original owners
     of the land or to strangers: hence the
     general division of powers into those which
     relate to the land, and those which are
     collateral to it.

  7. Powers relating to the land are those given
     to some person having an interest in the land
     over which they are to be exercised. These
     again are subdivided into powers appendant
     and in gross.

  8. A power appendant is where a person has an
     estate in land, with a power of revocation
     and appointment, the execution of which falls
     within the compass of his estate; as, where a
     tenant for life has a power of making leases
     in possession.

  9. A power in gross is where a person has an
     estate in the land, with a power of
     appointment, the execution of which falls out
     of the compass of his estate, but,
     notwithstanding, is annexed in privity to it,
     and takes effect in the appointee, out of an
     interest vested in the appointer; for
     instance, where a tenant for life has a power
     of creating an estate, to commence after the
     determination of his own, such as to settle a
     jointure on his wife, or to create a term of
     years to commence after his death, these are
     called powers in gross, because the estate of
     the person to whom they are given, will not
     be affected by the execution of them.

 10. Powers collateral, are those which are given
     to mere strangers, who have no interest in
     the laud: powers of sale and exchange given
     to trustees in a marriage settlement are of
     this kind. Vide, generally, Powell on Powers,
     assim; Sugden on Powers, passim; Cruise,
     Dig. tit. 32, ch. 13; Vin. Ab. h.t.; C
     om. Dig. Poiar; 1 Supp. to Ves. jr. 40, 92,
     201, 307; 2 Id. 166, 200; 1 Vern. by Raithby,
     406; 3 Stark. Ev. 1199; 4 Kent, Com. 309; 2
     Lilly's Ab. 339; Whart. Dig. h.t.  See 1
     Story, Eq. Jur. Sec. 169, as to the execution
     of a power, and when equity will supply the
     defect of execution.

 11. This classification of powers is admitted to
     be important only with reference to the
     ability of the donee to suspend, extinguish
     or merge the power. The general rule is that
     a power shall not be exercised in derogation
     of a prior grant by the appointer. But this
     whole division of powers has been condemned'
     as too artificial and arbitrary.
				      
 12. Powell divides powers into general and
     particular powers. General powers are those
     to be exercised in favor of any person whom
     the appointer chooses.  Particular powers are
     those which are to be exercised in favor of
     specific objects.  4 Kent, Com. 311, Vide,

     Primary powers.

             <owl:seeAlso> <xk:fulcrum>
           
         Note: This use in mechanics, of power as a synonym 
               for force, is improper and is becoming obsolete.

     belief. --Shakespeare"> .
     
     11. (Optics) The degree to which a lens, mirror, or any
         optical instrument, magnifies; in the telescope, and
         usually in the microscope, the number of times it
         multiplies, or augments, the apparent diameter of an
         object; sometimes, in microscopes, the number of 
         times it multiplies the apparent surface.
         
     12. (Law) An authority enabling a person to dispose of an
         interest vested either in himself or in another

           gravitation, etc., or of animal and intelligent beings;
           and when predicated of these beings, it may indicate
           physical, mental, or moral ability or capacity.
